Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects – data structures consisting of data fields and methods – and their interactions to design and implement computer programs.

Basic Terminologies
Class: User-defined data type that defines a blueprint for creating objects.
Object: An instance of a class.
Attributes: Data members or variables that define the state of an object.
Methods: Functions associated with a class.
const: Run-time constants (details in later chapters)
constexpr: Compile-time constants (details in later chapters)
enum: User-defined data type that consists of a set of named integer constants.
Enums provide a way to create named integer values for a set of related items, making the code more readable and maintainable.

There are 4 Pillar of Object Oriented Programming
-> Encapsulation : Bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions or procedures) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class.

    -> Inheritance : Mechanism that allows a subclass or derived class to inherit attributes and behaviors from a base class or parent class.

    -> Polymorphism : Allows a single function or method to operate on different types of data or objects.

    -> Abstraction : Involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential features and ignoring the irrelevant details.
